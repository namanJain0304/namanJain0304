I am currently a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University in Canada and I'm extremely passionate about my major. I strive to do my best in order to reach excellence. Ever since I was in elementary school, I have been fascinated by the world of computer programming and its endless possibilities. I like to challenge myself and make the most of the knowledge I gain. I'm well-versed in Python and Java coding, handling MySQL database operations, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJs, and MongoDB. My learning abilities are advanced, and I can comprehend concepts easily. Additionally, I am friendly and engaging, which makes it easy to build relationships with people. Working on complex technical tasks and finding the best solution to each of them is something I greatly enjoy. Making sure every job I do is done to perfection brings me immense satisfaction.
